## Data
Dataset used in this project was downloaded from
[the Speech Commands Dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html) and than processed.

This is a set of one-second .wav audio files, each containing a single spoken English word. These words are from a small set of commands, and are spoken by a variety of different speakers. The audio files are organized into folders based on the word they contain
This is version 0.01 of the data set containing 64,727 audio files.
